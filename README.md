# ww_docker_config_sets
This is a repository for the development and maintenance of sets of Docker files for use with the WeBWorK project. We hope to maintain different sets of files for different use cases and using different base images, as well as instructions on modifying them to fit particular use cases. Credit for the original sets of Docker files is due to Pan Luo @xcompass from the University of British Columbia, which were contributed to https://github.com/openwebwork/webwork2
